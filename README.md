# Merge Sort Algorithm
Implementation MergeSort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment by implementing MergeSort, by measuring the experimental execution time for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for the same length.

Complexities: <br>
Best case: O(n*logn) <br>
Wrost case: O(n*logn) <br>
Average case: O(n*logn) <br> <br>

Comparison between InsertionSort and MergeSort <br>
We want to deduce the value of k (maximum crossing point between the curves) for your machine and implementation: <br>
The identification of the maximum value k beyond which MergeSort is always more efficient than InsertionSort.<br><br>

K = 245; The MergeSort time for arrays with dimension 245 elements and beyond, will be always better than InsertionSort
