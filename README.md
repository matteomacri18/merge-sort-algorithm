# merge-sort-algorithm
Implementation MergeSort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment by implementing MergeSort, by measuring the experimental execution time for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for the same length.

Best case: O(n*logn) <br>
Wrost case: O(n*logn) <br>
Average case: O(n*logn) <br>
