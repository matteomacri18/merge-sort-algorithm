# Merge Sort Algorithm
Implementation MergeSort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment by implementing MergeSort, by measuring the experimental execution time for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for the same length.

Complexities: <br>
Best case: O(n*logn) <br>
Wrost case: O(n*logn) <br>
Average case: O(n*logn) <br> <br>

Comparison between InsertionSort and MergeSort <br>
