Implementation MergeSort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment by implementing both InsertionSort that MergeSort, by measuring the experimental execution time for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for the same length, on both algorithms.

Complexities: <br>
Best case: O(n*logn)
Wrost case: O(n*logn)
Average case: O(n*logn)
